## 3. Quality Metrics and Trends

- **Average Data Quality Score:** **100.00/100**
- **Completeness Trend:** High, except where forecast endpoints returned truncated data or missing fields (notably for one API in one city).
- **Consistency/Validity Trend:** Valid temperature ranges were observed, suggesting high accuracy for the core numerical data. Low scores usually indicated missing secondary fields (e.g., specific wind direction codes).

## 4. Issues Encountered

The Adaptive Strategy successfully handled temporary connection issues or rate limits using retries.
The following hard issues remain:
- No critical issues requiring manual intervention were recorded.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Collection

1.  **Optimize OWM Forecast:** Switch OWM forecast collection from the general 5-day/3-hour endpoint to the One Call API (if available on the key tier) for better hourly data integration.
2.  **Granular Quality Check:** Implement a check for **data freshness** (e.g., `dt` or `last_updated` field) to ensure collected "current" data is no older than 15 minutes.
3.  **Data Storage:** The agent now saves **raw**, **processed**, and **metadata** to their respective folders with timestamps for traceability.
